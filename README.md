# Algorithms and datastructure

I intend to use this repository as a practice playground
([kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming))) as well as a
reminder of some common, simple, yet powerful algorithms. Where
elegant I will use transducers, which are great power tools to process
sequences.

Code here isn't shaped in the style I would use for professional
coding. Every team has some culture and opinions about code style and
it's better to stick to these common guidelines. Moreover code is
written primarily to be read by other human beings, or we would all of
us code in assembly for maximum performance if we were to target only
a machine readership. Code I write as part of a team is intended to
may have been written by anybody else in this team.

Code here is written in litterate programming thanks to Emacs and
org-mode. It means the code written in Clojure is derived from the
text files explining the reasoning behind it. I hope it makes it
easier to read.
