#+TITLE:Exercice 1.5: One away
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle exercice_1_dot_5_one_away.clj

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on
strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a
character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
one edit (or zero edits) away.
#+END_QUOTE

As usual when dealing with strings, that's to say linear data
structures, we can achieve $O(n)$ time complexity. As we have to run
through the string from the beginning to the end in the worst case
(strings are of equal length $n$) we can't do better than linear time.

         (< (inc (count a)) (count b)) false
         :default #(one-away a b false)))
  ([[a1 & a] [b1 & b] edit-seen?]
   (cond (= nil a1 b1) true
         (= a1 b1) #(one-away a b edit-seen?)
         edit-seen? false
         (= (first a) b1) #(one-away (rest a) b true)
         :default #(one-away a b true))))

  (is (not (response "pale" "bae"))))

The time complexity is linear and so is the additional space
complexity in the worst case.

Clojure standard function ~trampoline~ avoids stack consumption. It's
a work around JVM lack of tail call elimination.
