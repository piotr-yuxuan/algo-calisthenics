#+BEGIN_QUOTE
You are given a string =s= consisting of only uppercase english
characters and an integer =k=. You can choose up to =k= characters of
the string and replace them with any other uppercase English
character.

After performing at most =k= replacements, return the length of the
longest substring which contains only one distinct character.

* Initial considerations

* Chosen solution

As of now the best way I can think ofâ€¦

- Time complexity (average / best / worst): $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- Space complexity (average / best / worst): $\mathcal{O}(1)$
