#+BEGIN_QUOTE
You are given an integer array =heights= where =heights[i]= represents
the height of the =ith= bar.

You may choose any two bars to form a container. Return the maximum
amount of water a container can store.

* Initial considerations

As this exercice is taken from a bank about two-pointer strategy, it's
quite likely we can apply this technique. However, as customary let's
start with a naive, greedy approach that will be used in tests.

For clarity we consider that bars are separated by one unit, and takes
virtually no water space.

** Greedy approach

Consider all the possible combination of two bars. Compute the volume
of water they can contain, and track the largest volume.

* Chosen solution

As of now the best way I can think ofâ€¦

- Time complexity (average / best / worst): $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- Space complexity (average / best / worst): $\mathcal{O}(1)$
