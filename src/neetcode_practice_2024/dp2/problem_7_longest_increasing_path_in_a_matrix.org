* Initial considerations

* Performance techniques

(drafted by ChatGPT)

The different versions of this `solution` function illustrate a range
of algorithmic and micro-optimisation techniques that impact
performance. Below is a categorised summary of these techniques,
ordered by their performance impact (approximately reflected by
submission percentile):

**1. Top Performer (Beats 99.42%)**
- **Explicit 2D memoisation table (=dp=)**: avoids recomputation by
  storing results outside the recursive stack.
- **Avoids value reassignment**: Stores =x = matrix[i][j]= once per
  DFS call.
- **Compact max expression**: Uses =max(...)= with inline ternary
  conditions to reduce branching and improve readability/performance.
- **Avoids redundant function calls**: Ensures each =dfs= call is only
  invoked if the move is valid and the next value is greater.

**2. Slightly Slower Variant (98.25%)**
- **Same core structure as above**, but:
- **Unrolled conditions**: Uses =if= blocks instead of compact
  ternaries. While more readable, it introduces slightly more overhead
  and verbosity.

**3. Uses =functools.cache= (96%)**
- **Python 3.9+ memoisation with =@functools.cache=**: Stores
  recursive results without explicit =dp=, simplifying the code.
- **More readable edge case checks**: Slightly less efficient due to
  possible redundancy in bound checks.
- **Includes base case check for 1x1 matrices**, avoiding overhead.

**4. Slightly Different =cache= Version (95.61%)**
- Similar to the above, but:
- **Refactors edge-boundary checking into =if=/=elif= blocks** rather
  than combining into a single compound condition.
- May introduce marginal inefficiencies due to slightly more complex
  control flow.

**5. BFS Topological Sort (62.34%)**
- **Non-recursive approach**: Uses BFS with topological sorting and
  indegree counting.
- **Eliminates recursion and stack depth concerns**, suitable for very
  large matrices.
- **Parallel layer traversal**: Each level of BFS represents one step
  in the increasing path.
- **Less cache-friendly**: May incur more memory movement and less
  locality compared to DFS.

**6. Poorly Performing Versions (~5–6%)**
- **Parameter pollution**: Passes previous value =v= into DFS,
  increasing memoisation state complexity.
- **Memoisation key explosion**: =functools.cache= caches over
  additional parameter (=v=), leading to many redundant calls.
- **Redundant comparisons**: The value comparison (=v < matrix[i][j]=)
  is done at each call, even if unnecessary.
- **Inefficient recursive call layout**: Less precise condition
  handling, especially for boundaries.

*General Observations and Lessons*
- **Explicit 2D memoisation is faster than =functools.cache=** when
  the state is simple (i.e., only =i, j=).
- **Avoid passing extra DFS parameters unnecessarily**, as it
  increases memoisation space and cache misses.
- **Prefer in-place condition evaluation and early exits** to reduce
  call overhead.
- **Topological BFS is more robust for large inputs**, but typically
  slower due to memory and queue management overhead.

In summary, the top-performing solution succeeds through a combination
of precise DFS traversal, explicit memoisation, and minimal branching
— embodying a well-balanced mix of algorithmic rigour and code-level
efficiency.

* Chosen solution

As of now the best way I can think of…

- Time complexity (average / best / worst): $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- Space complexity (average / best / worst): $\mathcal{O}(1)$
