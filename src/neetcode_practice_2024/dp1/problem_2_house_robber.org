#+BEGIN_QUOTE
You are given an integer array =nums= where $nums[i]$ represents the
amount of money the ith house has. The houses are arranged in a
straight line, i.e. the $i^{th}$ house is the neighbor of the
$(i-1)^{th}$ and $(i+1)^{th}$ house.

You are planning to rob money from the houses, but you cannot rob two
adjacent houses because the security system will automatically alert
the police if two adjacent houses were both broken into.

Return the maximum amount of money you can rob without alerting the
police.

* Initial considerations

It seems that the thought process for dynamic programming should be to
find a subproblem and express its recurrence relation. A subproblem
usually has only one bound defined, and the other bound is quite blur
because it will be defined recursively by other subproblems.

In this problem, what helped me was to first draw the evolution of a
brute force algorithm. Then I drew a decision tree with indices of the
houses. I noticed that the problem repeated itself by a translation of
3, and that let me think we could focus on a relation between
$\text{nums}[0]$, $\text{nums}[1]$, $\text{nums}[2]$.

Then I wrote down the initial conditions:

\begin{cases}
    f(0) = \text{nums}[0] + f(2) \\
    f(1) = \text{nums}[0] + f(3)
\end{cases}

\[
\text{result} = \max\left( f(0), f(1) \right)
\]

This led me to this correct but not straigthwforward recurrence
relation:

\[
f(i) = \text{nums}[i] + \max\left( f(i+2), f(i+3) \right)
\]

* Chosen solution

As of now the best way I can think ofâ€¦

- Time complexity (average / best / worst): $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- Space complexity (average / best / worst): $\mathcal{O}(1)$
