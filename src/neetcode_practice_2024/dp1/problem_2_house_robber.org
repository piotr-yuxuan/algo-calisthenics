You are given an integer array =nums= where $nums[i]$ represents the
amount of money the ith house has. The houses are arranged in a
straight line, i.e. the $i^{th}$ house is the neighbor of the
$(i-1)^{th}$ and $(i+1)^{th}$ house.

You are planning to rob money from the houses, but you cannot rob two
adjacent houses because the security system will automatically alert
the police if two adjacent houses were both broken into.

Return the maximum amount of money you can rob without alerting the
police.

* Initial considerations

* Chosen solution

As of now the best way I can think ofâ€¦

- Time complexity (average / best / worst): $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- Space complexity (average / best / worst): $\mathcal{O}(1)$
