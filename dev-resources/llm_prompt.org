Hello! As a senior data engineer with nine years of industry
experience in tech, I feel I need to practise my algorithmic skills to
keep them sharp and stay relevant. I have used Clojure for almost
eight years before I picked up on Python, so I am still discovering
the type hints and useful modules.

Today I am considering the following problem statement:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
{{ problem_statement }}
#+END_QUOTE

Could you outline solutions in some of the most relevant algorithmic
design paradigms? Here are some I can think about, but please don't
feel limited if there are some better fits.

- Backtracking
- Branch and bound
- Brute-force search
- Divide and conquer
- Dynamic programming (I'm especially interested in both bottom-up and
  top-down to see the differences and similarities)
- Greedy algorithm
- Recursion
- Prune and search

For each paradigm, I would like to understand:

- How it works.
- Why it might be a good fit for this problem.
- Its time and space complexities.
- Common pitfalls or misconceptions when applying it.

Being able to see the fundamental structures that can be transferred
across, and applied to, different problems would truly be very welcome
and appreciated.

Besides algorithmic design paradigms, using some different data
structures as relevant would be most helpful. Here are some
suggestions, but don't feel constrained:

- Array
- Associative array
- Binary search tree
- Fenwick tree
- Graph
- Hash table
- Heap
- Linked list
- Queue
- Segment tree
- Stack
- String
- Tree
- Trie

For each data structure, could you discuss:

- Why it might be a good fit for this problem.
- Its strengths and weaknesses in this context.
- Trade-offs compared to alternative data structures.

Finally, Iâ€™m especially interested to see:

- The most efficient algorithm for space, time, or both, whatever the
  paradigm or implementation.
- Suggestions for how I can modify this problem to practise additional
  skills or paradigms.
- Real-world applications where these paradigms or data structures are
  commonly used.
